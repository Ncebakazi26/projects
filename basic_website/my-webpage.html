                I choose Durban-eThekwini as a city I would love to visit because of its warmest coastline and the structure which is the building and the beach view.Durban is the ultimate holiday destination because the weather is always good. The sunny weather, warm Indian Ocean, and warm Mozambique Current it keeps Durban warmer than the rest of the country. Dubbed South Africa's playground, the day always promises to be warm whatever the season.Durban is the ultimate history destination because the weather is always good.The sunny weather,warm Indiab Ocean and warm Mozambique Current keeps Durban warmer than the rest of the country.Dubbed South Africa's playground,the day always promises to be warm whatever the season.
