                <p>I choose Durban-eThekwini as a city I would love to visit because of its warmest coastline and the
                    structure
                    which is the building and the beach view.Durban is the ultimate holiday destination because the

                    is
                    always good. The sunny weather, warm Indian Ocean, and warm Mozambique Current it keeps Durban
                    warmer
                    than
                    the rest of the country. Dubbed South Africa's playground, the day always promises to be warm
                    whatever
                    the
                    season.Durban is the ultimate history destination because the weather is always good.The sunny
